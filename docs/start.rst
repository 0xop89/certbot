=====================
Quick Start
=====================

Start Here
============

Use the the `interactive installation guide <https://certbot.eff.org>`_.

What you’ll find there:

* Installation instructions
* Instructions for getting a certificate
* Automated renewal instructions

You only need to go to the Manual Installation section if you have special needs: 
an unusual server or configuration, if you need to modify an existing certificate, 
if you need to run special scripts automatically before or after installation.


Getting Help
============

If you're having problems, we recommend posting on the Let's Encrypt
`Community Forum <https://community.letsencrypt.org>`_.
